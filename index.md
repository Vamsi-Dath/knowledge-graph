This handbook serves as the definitive guide for conducting a Design Study Lite following the established 9-week methodology. It is a dual-purpose document: a comprehensive research framework for systematic visualization design and a detailed process log for documenting collaborative design evolution.

The methodology is designed to meticulously capture the entire process of collaborative visualization design, from initial domain problem identification to final evaluation and reflection.

## Methodology Framework

This handbook implements the Design Study "Lite" Methodology organized into five main phases corresponding to a 9-week research cycle:

### **Phase 1: Abstract (Weeks 1-2)**
*Project Proposal, Team Charter, Domain Expert Interviews, Problem Identification, Task Abstraction*

### **Phase 2: Design (Weeks 3-4)**  
*Initial Sketches, Feedback Sessions, Data Gathering, Digital Prototyping*

### **Phase 3: Build (Weeks 5-6)**
*Interactive Visualization Implementation, Technical Development, Iterative Refinement*

### **Phase 4: Evaluate (Weeks 7-8)**
*Usability Testing, Qualitative Assessment, Feedback Integration*

### **Phase 5: Post-Design Study (Week 9)**
*Collaborative Authoring Analysis, Methodology Reflection, Knowledge Synthesis*

## Detailed Methodology Overview

### Stage 1: Abstract Phase (Weeks 1-2)
**Focus:** Domain problem characterization, semi-structured interviews, task abstraction

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Does the project proposal properly outline the domain problem to be solved?
- What modalities were involved in conducting the semi-structured interviews and their lineage?
- How effective was the task characterization (translation of domain problems into abstract tasks)?
- Was task typology (Brehmer & Munzner) applied to its full potential?
- Did supplementation with analytic task taxonomy (Amar et al.) enable finer-grain task description?

**Deliverables:**

- **1.2-Interview-Log.md** - Semi-structured interview documentation and modality analysis
- **1.3-Task-Abstraction-Log.md** - Systematic task characterization using established frameworks
- **1.4-Task-Taxonomies.md** - Integration of Brehmer & Munzner with Amar et al. taxonomies

### Stage 2: Design Phase (Weeks 3-4)
**Focus:** Iterative sketching, data exploration, digital prototyping, feedback integration

**Evaluation Questions:**
- How many iterations of data cleaning and mining occur throughout exploration?
- Which platforms generate exploratory visualizations and how do they differ?
- How do artifacts evolve after feedback sessions?
- How effective are sketches and storyboards in representing identified tasks?

- Was the task typology (Brehmer and Munzner) applied to its total potential?
- Did they supplement it with the analytic task taxonomy (Amar et al.), enabling finer grain description of lower tasks?

### Design Phase (Weeks 3-4)
- How many iterations of data cleaning and mining are done throughout the exploratory phase?
- Which platforms are used to generate exploratory visualizations, and how do they differ in usage?
- How do artifacts evolve after the feedback session?
- How effective are sketches and storyboards in representing tasks identified from the abstract phase?
- How much evolution can be seen from initial sketches to final digital sketches?
- Are standard drawing tools sufficient to properly create static versions of final visualizations?

- Does implementation include minimum requirements: 2+ visual encoding techniques, proper color channel usage, brushing & linking interactivity, details-on-demand interactivity?
- Is feedback throughout properly taken into account?
- Are final visualizations exploratory friendly?

### Evaluate Phase (Weeks 7-8)

*Note: While some questions may appear redundant, they are relevant to specific stages of the design process and enable comprehensive methodology validation.*
