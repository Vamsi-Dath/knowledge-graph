This meeting was in person at the DPI offices.

Attending: Jaggi Yetedore, Dr. Ashish Sharma, Dr. Abhinav Wadhwa, Winston, Vamsi Dath, Kirill Makienko

This isnt a full transcription but a summary of the topic discussed.

First Dr Abhinav introduced us to everyone working for the Cleets project, and we started explaining what the project was about

We were waiting on Winston to download the data from the server and copy it to the SSD we brought.

Dr. Ashish entered the room and we started discussing details about the project, they mentioned that they are working with mapbox as well as google maps,
They expressed an interest in this project being a base framework on which upon they can further build

Winston showed Kirill and Vamsi the server room

Kirill started talking about his approach to the problem and Dr. Abhinav clarified a very important detail:
Kirill's original approach assumed that DPI had a model which projected the weather / predicted future weather that he could use to his advantage.
Dr. Abhinav clarified that no such model exists (yet) and its expected from Kirill to either create data for the in between two of the data readings or to create a simple model to 
project the weather and use that in between the hour long readings for the driver simulation algorithm to work.

Finally Winston showed Vamsi and Kirill how the data was organized and which folders to look into.

Vamsi and Kirill left the building and went back to the campus while discussing about the requirement changes
