[Time_Component] - [Scope]

[Time_Component] was the [Timeline] [to_know] [Agenda]. 

[Computer_Expert] [recieved] [Instruction] [Scope] and [Instruction], and in [Task] [Scope] i've been [Task] [Problem] [Scope]. 

Ive [been_told] that I should [Instruction], the [System] is something that [Computer_Expert] is [Development] [Scope] the [Data] [Scope].

[Computer_Expert]'ve [been_working] [Scope] [to_make] a [Simulation] to [Task] whether [Scope] [Scope] [Domain_Concept] [State] [Scope] as a [Data_Subject] [State], and [think_on] how [Task], at the same time [State] [Documentation] [Scope] I've had with the [Domain_Expert] and [State] on the [Design_Concept] [Scope]. I've [State] [Data] [Task] and [Time_Component] [Computer_Expert]  [received] a much larger [Template] and [Template] [Instruction] [Scope].

[Computer_Expert] [hope_to] [Scheduling] [with] the [Domain_Expert] [Time_Component] to [Agenda], [Computer_Expert]'ll be 
[working_on] [Task] an [Presentation] [in_which] I present my [Proposal] in [Time_Component] so the [Domain_Expert] [Agenda], [Computer_Expert] [Assumption] [Audience] had with the [Domain_Expert] [Scope] [Time_Component] so [Agenda] is [Priority] [if] [Domain_Expert] [want_to] [Agenda].

Also [Time_Component] [Computer_Expert] keep [working] on the [Proposal] and [Task] [Scope] Ill be doing [for] the [System]. 

[Time_Component] [Computer_Expert] [State] to [Data] [Outcome], and [if] [Computer_Expert] [Expectation] [Time_Component] and [Domain_Expert] [Expectation],
[Computer_Expert] also [Expectation] [Scope] such as the [Web_Component], so [Computer_Expert] [Expectation] [Time_Component] seeing that [Timeline] [State].
