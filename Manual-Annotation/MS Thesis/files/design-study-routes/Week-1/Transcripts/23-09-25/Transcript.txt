00:00:00 Kirill Makienko
One thing, let me record this meeting so I can later just, you know, take notes on it.
00:00:06 Kirill Makienko
So my name is Kirill Makienko
00:00:09 Kirill Makienko
I'm a Mexican CS student.
00:00:11 Kirill Makienko
I'm another an undergrad and I'm here at the at UIC working under Fabian Iranda for the semester, right?
00:00:19 Kirill Makienko
So the project we've been thinking about was
00:00:24 Kirill Makienko
relating to cleats about creating a some visualization for right for like flood for like floods viewing things.
00:00:41 Kirill Makienko
But Dr.
00:00:42 Kirill Makienko
Fabian Miranda told me that you had like something different in mind, right?
00:00:47 Kirill Makienko
Something about like tracking routes that are in like extreme weather.
00:00:55 Ashish Sharma
Yeah.
00:00:56 Ashish Sharma
Yeah.
00:00:58 Kirill Makienko
So I would love to like meet the what's the motivation behind the project.
00:01:04 Kirill Makienko
What's your current like workflow currently?
00:01:08 Kirill Makienko
What could I do to like automate it or make it easier for you to progress your your research, right?
00:01:14 Ashish Sharma
Yeah.
00:01:16 Ashish Sharma
Okay.
00:01:17 Ashish Sharma
So maybe should I?
00:01:20 Ashish Sharma
speak or you have thought?
00:01:22 Kirill Makienko
Please, you go ahead.
00:01:23 Ashish Sharma
So I think, Carol, what I was thinking is, every state faces severe weather.
00:01:33 Ashish Sharma
And when you have severe weather that could be tornadoes, square lines or high impact weather in any form of, that really disrupts multiple sectors.
00:01:46 Ashish Sharma
And we were thinking of disruption on route transportation.
00:01:49 Ashish Sharma
So imagine a tornado passing from west to east, and then there is an interest rate and so on, on a highway.
00:02:00 Ashish Sharma
Can we track the CV weather going or convict or high impact convection happening, a lot of rainfall dumping?
00:02:08 Ashish Sharma
A lot of trucks and heavy duty vehicles have to stop, every vehicle have to stop on the side so that the CV weather passes.
00:02:15 Ashish Sharma
How can we create a warning system where
00:02:18 Ashish Sharma
we can observe the severe weather.
00:02:21 Ashish Sharma
And when the severe weather passes, then you can go from there, go from there or provide an alternate path.
00:02:29 Ashish Sharma
Analogy to this is an aviation industry.
00:02:32 Ashish Sharma
When a severe weather, there is a route already defined from, say, going from Chicago to Florida.
00:02:39 Ashish Sharma
And then when there is a severe weather that comes in the way, which is sudden, then
00:02:45 Ashish Sharma
the aviation industry reroutes that their craft to go from a different election, right?
00:02:52 Ashish Sharma
How can we replicate something like this over the road?
00:02:57 Ashish Sharma
So either rerouting or creating a warnings for the commuters that we would not like you to travel during this time.
00:03:05 Ashish Sharma
If you pass this region during this period of time, you will face severe weather.
00:03:10 Ashish Sharma
And the risk due to severe weather is this much.
00:03:17 Ashish Sharma
So imagine in aviation industry, what they do, this routes are already, the coordinates are already defined.
00:03:23 Ashish Sharma
So for us, the coordinates are the road network, right?
00:03:26 Ashish Sharma
Those are already.
00:03:29 Ashish Sharma
Okay.
00:03:30 Ashish Sharma
But for when the congestion happens, you reroute the traffic from going from one location to another because of congestion that we see already on Google Maps.
00:03:38 Ashish Sharma
Imagine this for severe weather, you are rerouting the traffic based on severe weather.
00:03:44 Kirill Makienko
Okay.
00:03:45 Ashish Sharma
So either rerouting, either you give the choice to the user.
00:03:48 Ashish Sharma
If you really want to drive right now, you have to take the reroute that will take you two more hours, or you wait for half an hour to go, and which is the shortest distance for you to go, and so on.
00:04:01 Kirill Makienko
Okay.
00:04:01 Ashish Sharma
Rerouting algorithms, developing rerouting algorithms based on severe weather.
00:04:07 Ashish Sharma
So for that, there are two parts.
00:04:09 Ashish Sharma
First developing rerouting algorithms, and then before that is to track the storms.
00:04:14 Ashish Sharma
or the high impact weather for the software engineers to think of rerouting.
00:04:23 Kirill Makienko
Okay.
00:04:24 Ashish Sharma
Yeah.
00:04:25 Kirill Makienko
Okay, yeah, I can see it.
00:04:27 Kirill Makienko
And have you...
00:04:30 Ashish Sharma
So if you're looking at data for weather related studies, we have been running one kilometer resolution weather simulations for the whole state of Illinois.
00:04:43 Ashish Sharma
So state of Lenoi is our testbed.
00:04:45 Ashish Sharma
So you can use that data.
00:04:47 Ashish Sharma
We can give you access to the data to analyze few events and from those events developing those algorithms.
00:04:58 Ashish Sharma
And then those algorithms should sit whenever severe weather hits, whenever threshold is hit, kicked in, then that really helps rerouting.
00:05:07 Kirill Makienko
Yeah, I was just going to ask if you have like being your work that you have done, if you have like any sort of data that could help me, for example, do something that could given any pattern, right?
00:05:19 Ashish Sharma
Yeah, so if I can get my screen share access.
00:05:22 Kirill Makienko
Yeah, I just granted.
00:05:24 Ashish Sharma
Okay, so this is the map, for example, you're going say from Chicago, Chicago to say, Springfield,
00:05:38 Ashish Sharma
Springfield.
00:05:39 Ashish Sharma
Okay.
00:05:41 Ashish Sharma
You see this route, right?
00:05:43 Ashish Sharma
You can also see an alternate route, right?
00:05:48 Kirill Makienko
Yes.
00:05:48 Ashish Sharma
We can compute, let's say, wind speed on these routes right now.
00:05:56 Ashish Sharma
We are already showing the wind speed, but collected load.
00:06:06 Ashish Sharma
You see their routing algorithms can really tell you from comparing two paths, which is the route that is recommended.
00:06:16 Ashish Sharma
But imagine a storm going from here to there, right?
00:06:19 Ashish Sharma
Can we provide much more information for a commuter going from Springfield to Chicago?
00:06:25 Ashish Sharma
Or even if you go from, say, Juliet to Chicago, even at a such a smaller distances, because the convective storms are very small, intense and small.
00:06:38 Ashish Sharma
How can we inform departments of transportation or push warnings into people's cell phones that, guys, there's a severe weather coming and don't go?
00:06:48 Ashish Sharma
Because it has happened to me in the past, I was going, I was driving from, where is a Champaign, Champaign to Bloomington.
00:06:56 Ashish Sharma
I was at my friend's house in Bloomington and Mohammed, this area we were passing and there were some square lines passing from here.
00:07:04 Ashish Sharma
It was such a severe weather.
00:07:07 Ashish Sharma
We were so afraid to drive even 100 meters.
00:07:09 Ashish Sharma
We had to stop and we were afraid to even stop that where should we stop because there are those boards telling us directions, maybe they fall.
00:07:19 Ashish Sharma
So how can I tell the
00:07:23 Ashish Sharma
commuters to stop here rather than just getting close to the storm.
00:07:28 Kirill Makienko
Okay.
00:07:29 Ashish Sharma
So we can think of those frameworks for decision supports system, but first step is to understand and track the storms.
00:07:40 Ashish Sharma
And then then I just wanted to be open.
00:07:42 Ashish Sharma
Like what do you think?
00:07:43 Ashish Sharma
What's the best way to do it if we want to create a decision support system and we want people to
00:07:49 Ashish Sharma
provide advance warning, not a day before, maybe half an hour before, an hour before or two hours before the storm will pass here.
00:07:56 Ashish Sharma
So commuters, please be aware.
00:07:59 Fabio Miranda
So Ashish, this data that you're showing us, this is static data, right?
00:08:03 Fabio Miranda
What?
00:08:04 Ashish Sharma
Do you mean static?
00:08:07 Fabio Miranda
The wind speed here is for a given time step, right?
00:08:11 Ashish Sharma
So wind speed here is, sorry, wind speed here is today's speed right now.
00:08:18 Ashish Sharma
So this is the forecasting system.
00:08:20 Ashish Sharma
So let's look at the wind speed.
00:08:22 Fabio Miranda
But what I mean is, as the truck goes from point A to B, yes.
00:08:29 Fabio Miranda
Is it using the same time or is it changing according to the, you know?
00:08:34 Fabio Miranda
route of the.
00:08:35 Ashish Sharma
That would be interesting if we can change it according to route, right?
00:08:38 Ashish Sharma
Because if you go from point A to point B, it starts says, for example, 2am here, 2pm here, you'll reach 4pm.
00:08:45 Ashish Sharma
So what, and then we know the speed of the roads, road networks, right?
00:08:49 Ashish Sharma
The designated speed.
00:08:51 Ashish Sharma
How can we assign, imagine on the road, red, green, blue, warning systems?
00:08:59 Ashish Sharma
So by the time you reach here, it would be red.
00:09:03 Ashish Sharma
Or
00:09:04 Ashish Sharma
Alternatively, the way congestion maps are, it's red right now here, right?
00:09:07 Ashish Sharma
That is that is easy to do to do show red right now at a at a future location because we know the weather, but it's very interesting to show future red that will come there in that in that in that segment of the road.
00:09:22 Fabio Miranda
Yeah.
00:09:23 Fabio Miranda
Is there a way to sample us this data maybe?
00:09:29 Fabio Miranda
Yeah.
00:09:31 Fabio Miranda
in whatever format you guys.
00:09:33 Ashish Sharma
Yeah, NetCDF.
00:09:35 Fabio Miranda
Yeah.
00:09:36 Ashish Sharma
So at the end of the day, we want to implement here, these things here.
00:09:41 Ashish Sharma
I believe we'll ask Winston, he would have these data sets in NetCDF, but he will might also have in GeoJSON format and TIF formats.
00:09:52 Fabio Miranda
That's perfect.
00:09:53 Fabio Miranda
And can we agree on some time range?
00:09:56 Fabio Miranda
What would be the time range of interest?
00:10:01 Ashish Sharma
So, Fabio, I think we started doing these simulations, live simulations starting June, I believe.
00:10:09 Ashish Sharma
June to September, we have the data.
00:10:11 Ashish Sharma
But the art is to learn from the past data so that we can create algorithms which will predict right now and for feature.
00:10:20 Ashish Sharma
So I don't know how to frame it in a computer size language, but we have the data to train the model and see, okay, can we predict it for the next
00:10:29 Ashish Sharma
next few days, whenever see where weather is about to hit.
00:10:33 Fabio Miranda
Yeah, well, maybe to make it manageable for a kilo, if we can just focus on past dates and then just pretend, you know, we have data for 12 p.m.
00:10:47 Fabio Miranda
Well, we have data from eight to four.
00:10:51 Fabio Miranda
But we pretend that the person is living at 12 and everything after 12 is some prediction, because then we can decouple prediction from the visualization routing problem.
00:11:04 Ashish Sharma
Yes, so for example, I just loaded.
00:11:07 Ashish Sharma
say, forecast of rainfall, right?
00:11:10 Ashish Sharma
So forecast of rainfall, and I'm looking.
00:11:13 Ashish Sharma
So this is the rain, this is the rain events which we are showing, right?
00:11:20 Ashish Sharma
So if the rain events are happening, let's put here, right?
00:11:27 Ashish Sharma
So IAT, right?
00:11:29 Ashish Sharma
IAT, this rain event is happening.
00:11:31 Ashish Sharma
So how can we advise
00:11:38 Ashish Sharma
trucks who are going from on IAT for long distances, right, to avoid this patch.
00:11:47 Ashish Sharma
Yeah.
00:11:48 Ashish Sharma
Like, define the problem.
00:11:49 Ashish Sharma
Yeah, here.
00:11:50 Ashish Sharma
I think we have not zoomed out.
00:11:52 Ashish Sharma
So this is IAT patch.
00:11:55 Ashish Sharma
If it is happening here, it doesn't matter to us.
00:11:58 Ashish Sharma
On IAT, it matters right now.
00:12:02 Ashish Sharma
So this is a very severe event would happen for an hour, let's say.
00:12:06 Ashish Sharma
So how can we tell commuters from Davenport to coming to Chicago that there is a severe weather happening at 7:00 AM on September 24th?
00:12:19 Ashish Sharma
So that they can think of.
00:12:24 Ashish Sharma
Yeah.
00:12:26 Fabio Miranda
So what's the variable here?
00:12:28 Fabio Miranda
Is this right?
00:12:29 Ashish Sharma
This is rainfall.
00:12:31 Ashish Sharma
So we have rainfall.
00:12:32 Ashish Sharma
We have every variable.
00:12:33 Ashish Sharma
We have rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed.
00:12:37 Ashish Sharma
So we need to come up with some threshold where when you're looking in the model.
00:12:42 Ashish Sharma
So the threshold has to be two ways, right?
00:12:44 Ashish Sharma
It has to be spatially gridded as well.
00:12:48 Ashish Sharma
So it has to be big enough.
00:12:50 Ashish Sharma
And if you find one grid point, which is a lot more value, it won't make a difference.
00:12:56 Ashish Sharma
We need to have some spatial presence.
00:12:58 Ashish Sharma
for that.
00:12:59 Ashish Sharma
So think of this like hurricane.
00:13:01 Ashish Sharma
Hurricane you're tracking, but hurricane will extend for a long period of time.
00:13:05 Ashish Sharma
It's easy to track.
00:13:08 Ashish Sharma
How do we track these storms of this size and we specify a threshold above this threshold, if it is at least this big and passing through these larger interstates, how can we capture them?
00:13:24 Ashish Sharma
Then we can think of a smaller roads within the city of Chicago, but let's focus on interstates maybe.
00:13:30 Fabio Miranda
Is this threshold the same for the entire state?
00:13:33 Ashish Sharma
I think we have to create a threshold.
00:13:36 Ashish Sharma
I think this is where we need some thinking to think of what threshold which has become dangerous for commuters.
00:13:46 Ashish Sharma
So when once someone plays with the data, they need to think about the severity of this term.
00:13:52 Ashish Sharma
maybe then look at the wind vectors there, how intense is the wind?
00:13:56 Ashish Sharma
And then we come up with an argument with this much wind, this is extreme.
00:14:02 Ashish Sharma
This much rainfall also it is extreme.
00:14:04 Ashish Sharma
When rainfall and wind are coupled by this much, then it's an extreme, then we like to look at it.
00:14:08 Fabio Miranda
Yeah.
00:14:10 Fabio Miranda
And I imagine that the threshold will be different if it's a highway or some in the road, right?
00:14:17 Ashish Sharma
Yes, highway, I think when there is no vegetation I have driven, but when we drive on the highway, there's nothing and there is a cross flow happening, the cars will just shake complete a lot.
00:14:31 Ashish Sharma
And if you're driving at a very high speed, you might even lose the balance.
00:14:35 Ashish Sharma
So
00:14:37 Ashish Sharma
When I drive my car, I even get a warning as soon as a storm appearing 50 miles, 50 miles radius.
00:14:42 Kirill Makienko
Also, should we like consider different threshold for, for example, trucks?
00:14:49 Kirill Makienko
We know with like their like big cargo base that could like fall over because of wind or should we like for now just consider one overgeneration.
00:14:57 Ashish Sharma
You can just.
00:14:59 Ashish Sharma
consider something average when we show here.
00:15:01 Ashish Sharma
That is something interesting.
00:15:03 Ashish Sharma
We have this larger project where we are working with these agent based models where they could look at different thresholds of different weights of vehicles that where it would impact them and how.
00:15:14 Ashish Sharma
So yeah, that's a good question, but I think we can keep it a little bit simple right now.
00:15:19 Ashish Sharma
We can use that level of complexity next.
00:15:21 Fabio Miranda
Yeah.
00:15:22 Fabio Miranda
We can never add more complexity.
00:15:25 Fabio Miranda
So you mentioned the trees along the highway, right?
00:15:29 Fabio Miranda
Later on, is there a way it should attack the trees from the street level?
00:15:35 Fabio Miranda
So that, you know, that acts as a some factor that will reduce the threshold for that specific highway.
00:15:45 Ashish Sharma
Yes.
00:15:47 Fabio Miranda
Sounds perfect.
00:15:48 Fabio Miranda
So I think the
00:15:51 Fabio Miranda
the true pressing things that we will need.
00:15:53 Fabio Miranda
Well, we already got the tasks and a general scheme of what we need to build.
00:16:00 Ashish Sharma
What kind of format of data do you need?
00:16:03 Ashish Sharma
NetCDF, GeoJson, TIFF.
00:16:05 Fabio Miranda
I think, well, maybe TIF and NetCDF.
00:16:11 Fabio Miranda
Okay.
00:16:12 Ashish Sharma
So I asked Vincent to provide that information to the access to three months of data set to, yeah.
00:16:20 Fabio Miranda
That's perfect.
00:16:21 Fabio Miranda
And maybe, you know, Kiro can follow up so that we have that on top of our mind.
00:16:27 Fabio Miranda
And I think we, yeah, we got enough from today to start building this.
00:16:32 Ashish Sharma
Yes, wonderful.
00:16:33 Ashish Sharma
Thank you.
00:16:34 Ashish Sharma
Thank you.
00:16:34 Ashish Sharma
Cool.
00:16:35 Vamsi Dath
I have one more clarification to ask.
00:16:37 Vamsi Dath
Yeah, sorry.
00:16:38 Vamsi Dath
So, hi, Ashis, I'm Omsi.
00:16:40 Vamsi Dath
I'm also actually working on the project as well.
00:16:43 Vamsi Dath
So, in that example which you're showing, right, like the civil rainfall at around 7 A.m.,
00:16:49 Vamsi Dath
So if you can see, I mean, I don't know if it is for that particular case or not, from 6 to 8, it's actually cutting too many highways between, I mean, two points, right?
00:17:00 Vamsi Dath
Let us say Davenport in Chicago.
00:17:02 Vamsi Dath
Yes.
00:17:03 Vamsi Dath
Then the storm actually would impact multiple roads going from Davenport to Chicago.
00:17:07 Vamsi Dath
So it would impact the alternative paths as well.
00:17:10 Vamsi Dath
So, yeah, so in your solution, like, is it comple?
00:17:13 Vamsi Dath
I mean,
00:17:14 Vamsi Dath
Is it a need to actually assess for all of those roads and so and show the impact?
00:17:19 Ashish Sharma
So algorithm should assess for all the road networks, but wherever user wants to go from point A to point B, it should show the risk and maybe potential less risky pathways.
00:17:31 Ashish Sharma
So it's a complicated problem that we're asking, but we can break it down a little bit.
00:17:36 Ashish Sharma
Because when user will not say, okay, I just want to go from here, it has to show for, it has to regret for the whole database, figure out wherever these hotspots are of, and maybe every time the frame is moving, they should follow that.
00:17:53 Ashish Sharma
And when the risk goes, they should drop that risk, right?
00:17:56 Ashish Sharma
And if user asks for going for directions from point A to point B during that time, then we tell the risk.
00:18:04 Ashish Sharma
So maybe there should be a flow chart or a should be prepared first before we try to execute this.
00:18:15 Vamsi Dath
Okay, so correct me if I'm wrong.
00:18:18 Vamsi Dath
Firstly, you are expecting a high-level solution as in even before selecting any two points as AI mean, starting at an ending point, you want to see the impact of that particular event on all of those parts, I mean, within a state.
00:18:33 Ashish Sharma
But you don't have to show that to the viewer, because you have to do that as a prior work, right?
00:18:39 Ashish Sharma
Because if a user might ask any two locations anytime.
00:18:44 Vamsi Dath
All right, so that should be in hand, but then the actual visualization would only show it after selection of those set points.
00:18:50 Ashish Sharma
Yeah, so and from a software engineering lens, I don't know if that's the right way or you would like to only do when the user selects point A to point B and then you look at, okay, does there any strong passes here?
00:19:02 Ashish Sharma
Maybe if that is easier, that is fine too.
00:19:06 Ashish Sharma
From okay, I think data data, uh, crigging and data and analysis per perspective.
00:19:13 Ashish Sharma
There is no point looking at the whole map.
00:19:15 Ashish Sharma
But if we know these are the two locations that user want to go, then at that time dynamically we calculate that and figure it out and then push that information.
00:19:23 Ashish Sharma
So that's for software engineers to tell me which is the easier path to do it.
00:19:28 Ashish Sharma
And because we would want
00:19:30 Ashish Sharma
We don't want it to be static.
00:19:32 Ashish Sharma
It's a dynamic program, right?
00:19:33 Ashish Sharma
We want the less lag time to give this information to the user.
00:19:40 Abhinav Wadhwa
Ashish, I have something to show.
00:19:42 Abhinav Wadhwa
I remember this from Curtis poster.
00:19:45 Abhinav Wadhwa
I'm just sharing my screen.
00:19:47 Ashish Sharma
By the way, I have to drop at five four minutes.
00:19:49 Ashish Sharma
I have to talk to NSF product.
00:19:54 Abhinav Wadhwa
Yeah, I'll just quickly show.
00:19:56 Abhinav Wadhwa
So Bamsi to your questions, this see how one of our partners in Kleeds are doing from NSF, they're doing, NCAR, they're doing this.
00:20:05 Abhinav Wadhwa
So you have a storm passing, you have the whole road network, and you have categorized all the roads based on whatever risk they are on.
00:20:14 Abhinav Wadhwa
And then after this, the routing algorithm starts.
00:20:18 Abhinav Wadhwa
So you see here, they have categorized all those.
00:20:22 Abhinav Wadhwa
I'll share you this poster.
00:20:23 Abhinav Wadhwa
This is there in Atreets drive as well.
00:20:26 Abhinav Wadhwa
I just downloaded it from there.
00:20:27 Abhinav Wadhwa
And then they provide the alternative summary of each highway.
00:20:30 Abhinav Wadhwa
For example, it is I-70.
00:20:32 Abhinav Wadhwa
This is a time period.
00:20:33 Abhinav Wadhwa
This is a time period they are at risk.
00:20:36 Abhinav Wadhwa
So this is their internal dashboard.
00:20:37 Abhinav Wadhwa
They have not made it public.
00:20:39 Abhinav Wadhwa
And as I remember, you were starting that it is kind of very compute extensive task, but yeah, so this is how they provide summary.
00:20:50 Abhinav Wadhwa
So if you think this could be a good reference, you can use this.
00:20:53 Ashish Sharma
So we don't want to just provide somebody.
00:20:55 Ashish Sharma
We want it to be interactive with the user.
00:20:58 Ashish Sharma
That's the next level we want to go.
00:21:01 Fabio Miranda
OK.
00:21:02 Ashish Sharma
Yeah, I'll just quickly share this.
00:21:03 Ashish Sharma
Play with it.
00:21:04 Ashish Sharma
And then, OK, I want, we want it to effectively think of replace Google Maps where people see congestion, but we want to tell the routing based on weather.
00:21:14 Fabio Miranda
Right.
00:21:14 Fabio Miranda
Yeah.
00:21:15 Fabio Miranda
So that was amazing.
00:21:19 Fabio Miranda
I will debrief with the folks here, but I will ask here to follow up with you guys for the data, the link as well, as I've now the presentation that you showed us.
00:21:32 Fabio Miranda
But yeah, that was more than enough for the tasks that we will, for the system that we will build.
00:21:38 Fabio Miranda
Yeah.
00:21:40 Ashish Sharma
And then maybe you can pick one thing, right?
00:21:43 Ashish Sharma
What severe weather care are you focusing on to because there are hundreds rides of severe weathers?
00:21:49 Fabio Miranda
Yeah.
00:21:50 Fabio Miranda
I think we will make it generic so that, you know, you set the threshold for wind or flood or rain.
00:21:57 Fabio Miranda
And then we sort of iterate all these things.
00:22:01 Fabio Miranda
Okay, wonderful.
00:22:03 Fabio Miranda
But sounds great.
00:22:04 Fabio Miranda
Avnav and Ashish.
00:22:06 Fabio Miranda
Thank you so much.
00:22:06 Fabio Miranda
I will talk with the others here now.
00:22:09 Ashish Sharma
You take care guys.
00:22:11 Ashish Sharma
Bye.
00:22:11 Fabio Miranda
Thank you.
00:22:11 Fabio Miranda
Bye.
00:22:12 Kirill Makienko
Thank you.
