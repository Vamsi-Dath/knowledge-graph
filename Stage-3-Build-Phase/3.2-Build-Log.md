## Development Log

### Week 5, Day 2
**Task:** Implement brushing and linking  
**Decision:** Decided to use D3.js's event listeners (`.on("click", ...)`) to trigger updates in other charts. This is a common and robust pattern in D3.  
**Reasoning:** This is a direct implementation of the digital sketch's planned interaction. It allows the user to explore the data by filtering.

### Week 5, Day 4
**Task:** Implement details on demand (hover)  
**Decision:** Used D3's `.on("mouseover", ...)` and `.on("mouseout", ...)` events to show and hide a custom tooltip div.  
**Reasoning:** This allows the user to get more information without cluttering the charts, addressing the low-level task of "retrieve value."

### Week 6, Day 1
**Task:** Refine color palette  
**Decision:** The initial color palette for delays was too subtle. Changed to a sequential color scale from green (low delay) to red (high delay) to make the data more immediately understandable.  
**Reasoning:** Feedback from an informal check-in with a domain expert indicated that a more intuitive color scheme was needed to quickly identify problems.
