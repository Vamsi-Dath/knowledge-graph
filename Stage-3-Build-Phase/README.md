**Focus:** Interactive implementation, technical requirements fulfillment, iterative refinement

## Overview
This phase translates your digital prototypes into fully interactive web-based visualizations. You will implement technical requirements and integrate feedback throughout the development process.

## Evaluation Questions for This Stage
- How effectively are static digital sketches translated into web-based interactive visualizations?
- Does implementation include minimum requirements (2+ visual encoding techniques, proper color channel usage, brushing & linking, details-on-demand)?
- Is feedback throughout the process properly integrated?
- Are final visualizations exploration-friendly?

## Files in This Stage

### Core Deliverables
1. **[3.1-Interactive-Viz-Transport/](3.1-Interactive-Viz-Transport/)**
   - Complete interactive visualization implementation
   - Includes index.html, main.js, style.css, and documentation
   - **[Live Demo](3.1-Interactive-Viz-Transport/index.html)** - View the working visualization

2. **[3.2-Build-Log.md](3.2-Build-Log)**
   - Technical development process documentation
   - Implementation decisions and requirement validation

## Technical Requirements Checklist
Your implementation must include:
- [ ] **Minimum 2 visual encoding techniques** (position, color, size, etc.)
- [ ] **Proper color channel usage** for data encoding
- [ ] **Brushing & Linking interactivity** (selecting data in one chart highlights in another)
- [ ] **Details-on-demand interactivity** (hover for additional information)
- [ ] **Exploration-friendly interface** supporting user investigation

## Expected Outcomes
By completing this stage, you should have:
- [ ] Fully functional interactive visualization meeting all technical requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive build process documentation
- [ ] Systematic feedback integration throughout development
- [ ] Exploration-friendly visualization supporting domain expert tasks
