**Participant:** Mark (Domain Expert)
**Date:** Week 7, Day 3

**Task 1 (Compare):**
* **Behavior:** Mark immediately used the day-of-week filter. He noted that the line chart clearly showed lower delays on weekends.
* **Feedback:** "This is so much faster than pulling up two different spreadsheets and comparing them manually."
* **Insight:** The filter and line chart effectively addressed the "compare" task.

**Task 2 (Find Anomaly):**
* **Behavior:** Mark hovered over a spike in the line chart. The tooltip correctly showed a large delay on a specific day. He then checked the weather data and commented on the high rainfall on that day.
* **Feedback:** "I've always suspected rain was a major factor, but now I have some data to back it up."
* **Insight:** The details-on-demand and correlated views successfully enabled the "correlate" task and led to a key insight.

**Task 3 (Locate Hotspot):**
* **Behavior:** He used the bar chart to sort routes by average delay. He then clicked the top-ranked route, which highlighted its location on the map.
* **Feedback:** "It's clear that Route 42 is our biggest problem area. This map shows exactly where the delays are most concentrated."
* **Insight:** The brushing and linking functionality proved effective for a key task.

### Task 3: Locate High-Delay Geographic Areas  
**Start Time:** 04:30  
**End Time:** 06:15  
**Duration:** 1m 45s  
**Completion Status:** Completed

#### Observations:

| Time | Action/Behavior | User Quote | Notes |
|------|----------------|------------|-------|
| 04:30 | Immediately looked at the map view | "The map should show me the hotspots" | Direct approach to spatial task |
| 05:00 | Correlated map markers with bar chart | "These locations match the high-delay routes" | Using multiple views effectively |
| 05:45 | Noted geographic clustering | "The problem routes are all in the same area" | Spatial insight gained |
| 06:15 | Concluded about downtown congestion | "Downtown clearly has infrastructure issues" | Task completed with actionable insight |

#### Key Findings:
- **Comparison Method:** Used map markers sized by delay values, cross-referenced with bar chart
- **Visual Effectiveness:** Map visualization clearly showed geographic concentration of delays
- **Accuracy:** Correctly identified downtown area as problematic region

## Post-Test Interview Responses

### Overall Experience:
**Q: What was your overall impression of the tool?**
A: "This is exactly what we need for our transit planning meetings. The visual approach makes it so much easier to spot problems and explain them to management. Much better than our current spreadsheet reports."

**Q: What did you like most about it?**
A: "The way everything connects together - when I click on a route in the bar chart, I can immediately see it on the map and track its performance over time. That connection between views is really powerful."

**Q: What was most frustrating or confusing?**
A: "Nothing major. Maybe the color scheme could be more intuitive - I initially thought green meant 'go' but it actually means low delay, which is good. That took a moment to adjust to."

**Q: How does this compare to tools you currently use?**
A: "Night and day difference. We currently export data to Excel and create basic charts manually. This is interactive, faster, and reveals patterns we never would have spotted before."

### Specific Features:
**Q: How useful were the filtering options?**
A: "Very useful. Being able to focus on specific routes or time periods makes the analysis much more targeted. The 'all routes' option is great for getting the big picture first."

**Q: What did you think of the visual design and layout?**
A: "Clean and professional. The three-panel layout feels natural - overview, details, and geography. My colleagues would definitely be comfortable using this in presentations."

**Q: Were the interactions (hover, click, etc.) intuitive?**
A: "Yes, very intuitive. The hover tooltips give just the right amount of detail without cluttering the interface. Clicking to select routes felt natural."

**Q: How was the performance/responsiveness?**
A: "Fast and smooth. No lag when switching between views or applying filters. That's important when you're presenting to a room full of people."

### Improvement Suggestions:
**Q: What would make this tool more useful for your work?**
A: "Adding passenger count data would be huge - then we could see delay impact relative to ridership. Also, being able to export insights or share specific views would help with reporting."

**Q: What features are missing that you would expect?**
A: "Date range selection for historical analysis, and maybe some basic forecasting. Also, it would be great to overlay events like construction or weather alerts directly on the timeline."
