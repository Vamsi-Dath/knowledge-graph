**1. Introduction (5 minutes)**
* Thank the participant for their time.
* Explain the purpose of the test: to evaluate the visualization, not the user's abilities.
* Explain the "think-aloud" method: ask them to verbalize their thoughts throughout the session.

**2. Task Scenarios (20-30 minutes)**
* **Task 1: Compare:** "Using this dashboard, can you compare the average bus delay on a weekday versus a weekend?"
    * *Expectation:* The user should use the filtering or selection options to isolate weekdays and weekends.
* **Task 2: Find Anomaly:** "Looking at this data, can you find the single worst bus delay that occurred last week? What was the weather like on that day?"
    * *Expectation:* The user should be able to locate the outlier and use the correlated weather data to answer the second part of the question.
* **Task 3: Locate Hotspot:** "If you were a city planner, where would you recommend adding a new bus lane to solve a delay problem? Use the visualization to support your answer."
    * *Expectation:* The user should be able to identify a consistently delayed route on the map and correlate it with the line chart.

**3. Post-Test Interview (10 minutes)**
* "What was the most confusing part of using this tool?"
* "Did this tool help you find new information that you didn't know before?"
* "On a scale of 1-5, how satisfactory were the visualizations for your specific needs?"
