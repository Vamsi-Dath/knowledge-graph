**Focus:** Qualitative usability assessment, feedback integration, iterative refinement

## Overview
This phase conducts systematic usability evaluation of your interactive visualization through qualitative assessment with domain experts and target users. You will document testing procedures and integrate findings for final refinement.

## Evaluation Questions for This Stage
- Is accumulated feedback properly integrated into final artifacts?
- Are visualizations sufficiently exploration-friendly for end users?
- How is qualitative usability study performed and documented?
- How satisfactory are artifacts and final visualizations?
- Is additional iteration necessary based on evaluation outcomes?
