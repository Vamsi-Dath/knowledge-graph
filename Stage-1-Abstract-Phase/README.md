**Focus:** Domain problem characterization, semi-structured interviews, task abstraction

## Overview
This phase establishes the foundation for your design study through systematic domain analysis and task abstraction. You will conduct semi-structured interviews with domain experts and translate domain problems into abstract visualization tasks using established frameworks.

## Evaluation Questions for This Stage
- Does the project proposal properly outline the domain problem to be solved?
- What modalities were involved in conducting the semi-structured interviews and their lineage?
- How effective was the task characterization (translation of domain problems into abstract tasks)?
- Was task typology (Brehmer & Munzner) applied to its full potential?
- Did supplementation with analytic task taxonomy (Amar et al.) enable finer-grain task description?
