| Domain Problem | Domain Task (Explicit) | Abstract Task (Brehmer & Munzner) | Lower-Level Tasks (Amar et al.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bus delays are unpredictable. | "Find which routes are the most delayed." | **Identify:** Find a route with the highest average daily delay. | **Retrieve:** Get all bus data. **Filter:** Select data for a single day. **Aggregate:** Calculate average delay per route. **Sort:** Order routes by average delay. |
| Delays seem worse in the rain. | "See how delays change with bad weather." | **Correlate:** Find the relationship between weather and delays. | **Join:** Merge weather data with bus data. **Filter:** Select data for rainy days. **Aggregate:** Calculate average delay on rainy vs. non-rainy days. |
| There are specific delay hotspots. | "Find where the worst delays happen on a map." | **Geolocate:** Pinpoint geographical areas with frequent delays. | **Aggregate:** Count the number of delays per geographical region. **Filter:** Select data for a specific route or time. **Map:** Display delay events on a map. |
| Rush hour delays are a big issue. | "Compare delays in the morning vs. afternoon rush." | **Compare:** Contrast delay patterns across different time intervals. | **Filter:** Select data for morning (7-9 AM) and afternoon (4-6 PM) time windows. **Aggregate:** Calculate total delays for each window. |
