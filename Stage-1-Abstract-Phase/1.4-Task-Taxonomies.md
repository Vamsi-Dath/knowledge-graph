Understanding and applying these taxonomies is crucial for translating a domain problem into a visualization design. They provide a common language and a systematic approach to task abstraction.

### Brehmer and Munzner's Typology (2013)
This taxonomy provides a high-level, human-centered view of visualization tasks. It categorizes tasks into three top-level goals:

1.  **What does the user know?**
    * **Lookup:** Find a known item in a known location.
    * **Browse:** Look for an item without a specific target.
    * **Locate:** Find a known item in an unknown location.
    * **Explore:** Look for any unknown items or patterns.
2.  **Why does the user perform the task?**
    * **Enjoy:** For entertainment or aesthetic pleasure.
    * **Find Anomalies:** To spot unexpected patterns.
    * **Synthesize:** To combine information from different sources.
    * **Analyze:** To draw conclusions and gain insights.
3.  **How does the user interact?**
    * **Annotate:** Add notes or labels.
    * **Share:** Export or distribute.
    * **Present:** Create a presentation from a view.

For our bus delay case study, we focus on **Explore** (for finding unknown patterns) and **Analyze** (for drawing conclusions about delay causes).

### Amar, Eagan, and Stasko's Low-Level Task Taxonomy (2005)
This taxonomy provides a more granular, operational view of tasks that a visualization tool must support. It describes specific user actions.

1.  **Retrieve Value:** Find the value of a specific data point.
2.  **Filter:** Find data points that meet a condition.
3.  **Find Extremum:** Find the maximum or minimum value.
4.  **Sort:** Order data points based on a specific value.
5.  **Determine Range:** Find the range of values in a dataset.
6.  **Characterize Distribution:** Describe the overall shape of the data.
7.  **Find Anomalies:** Identify outliers.
8.  **Cluster:** Find groups of similar data points.
9.  **Correlate:** Find relationships between different data variables.

For our bus delay case study, we use these to specify our low-level tasks, as seen in the task abstraction log (e.g., **Filter** by day of the week, **Correlate** weather with delays).
