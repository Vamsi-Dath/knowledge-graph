**Tool:** Figma
**Purpose:** Create a high-fidelity static representation of the final visualization, including layouts and interactions.

**Layout:**
* **Top Section:** A large map of the city showing bus routes and color-coded delays.
* **Bottom-Left:** A bar chart showing average delay by route.
* **Bottom-Right:** A time-series chart showing daily average delays.
* **Side Panel:** Contains filter controls for day of the week, time of day, and weather.

**Interactions to be Implemented:**
* **Hover:** Hovering over a route on the map or a bar in the bar chart shows a tooltip with a detailed description (e.g., "Route 42: 12-minute average delay").
* **Click/Select:** Clicking a route in the bar chart highlights that route on the map and filters the time-series chart to show only data for that route.
* **Filter:** Using the side panel, users can select "Monday" or "Rainy Days" to filter all charts.

**Conclusion:** The digital sketch confirms that the three main views (map, bar chart, time series) can be effectively combined into a single dashboard. This sketch will be used as the blueprint for the build phase.
