**Task:** Merge GPS logs and weather data.
**Source:** `bus_gps_logs_raw.csv` (4.5M rows), `historical_weather.csv` (1K rows)
**Date:** Week 3, Day 2
**Steps:**
1.  **Handle Null Values:** Dropped ~1% of rows in `bus_gps_logs_raw.csv` where `bus_id` was null.
2.  **Timestamp Standardization:** Converted all timestamp columns to a single, consistent format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) to enable merging.
3.  **Merge Data:** Joined the two datasets on the nearest timestamp to the GPS log entry, effectively linking bus delays to weather conditions at that time.
4.  **Calculate Metrics:** Created a new column, `delay_minutes`, by subtracting the scheduled arrival time from the actual arrival time.
**Result:** A new, clean dataset `merged_bus_data.csv` with all the necessary fields for analysis.
