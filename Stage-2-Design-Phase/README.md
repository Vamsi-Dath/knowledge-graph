**Focus:** Iterative sketching, data exploration, digital prototyping, feedback integration

## Overview
This phase focuses on iterative design development through systematic sketching, data exploration, and digital prototyping. You will document design evolution and integrate feedback throughout the process.

## Evaluation Questions for This Stage
- How many iterations of data cleaning and mining occur throughout exploration?
- Which platforms generate exploratory visualizations and how do they differ?
- How do artifacts evolve after feedback sessions?
- How effective are sketches and storyboards in representing identified tasks?
- What evolution exists from initial to final digital sketches?
- Are standard drawing tools sufficient for static visualization representation?

## Files in This Stage

### Core Deliverables
1. **[2.1-Hand-Drawn-Sketch-Log.md](2.1-Hand-Drawn-Sketch-Log)**
   - Comprehensive sketching iteration documentation
   - Design evolution tracking through feedback cycles

2. **[2.2-Data-Cleaning-Log.md](2.2-Data-Cleaning-Log)**
   - Data relationship formulation and mining processes
   - Exploratory data analysis documentation

3. **[2.3-Digital-Sketch-Figma-Notes.md](2.3-Digital-Sketch-Figma-Notes)**
   - Platform comparison and digital design evolution
   - Tool effectiveness analysis for visualization design

4. **[2.4-Digital-Prototype-VegaLite.json](2.4-Digital-Prototype-VegaLite.json)**
   - Static prototype specification and feedback integration
   - Technical specification for implementation phase

## Expected Outcomes
By completing this stage, you should have:
- [ ] Comprehensive sketching iteration documentation with feedback integration
