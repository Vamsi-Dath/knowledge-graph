| Sketch ID | Date & Creator | Description | Design Rationale | Feedback & Evolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| S1-Map-Bar | Week 3, David | A map of bus routes with a simple bar chart. The map shows hotspots by color. The bar chart shows average delay by route. | I wanted to show both geographical and quantitative data in a single view. The bar chart makes it easy to compare routes. | Feedback from Lena: "The map is a great idea, but I need to see the delays over time, not just an average." New idea: Add a time-series chart. |
| S2-Timeline-Map | Week 3, David | A timeline showing daily delays linked to a map. When you select a day on the timeline, the map updates to show delays for that day. | This addresses the need for temporal analysis. Brushing and linking is a key interaction. | Feedback from Lena: "This is much better. Can we also filter by type of day (weekday vs. weekend)?" New idea: Add a filter control. |
| S3-Heatmap-Scatterplot | Week 3, Jessica | A heatmap showing average delay by time of day and day of the week. A scatterplot of delay vs. precipitation is also included. | This directly addresses the "correlation" task. The heatmap is a compact way to show a lot of data. | Feedback from Lena: "This is exactly what I need to check my theories about bad weather." This sketch will be the basis for a key part of the final visualization. |
