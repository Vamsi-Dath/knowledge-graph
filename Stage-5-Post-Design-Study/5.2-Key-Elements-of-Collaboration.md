  nav: "stages"
---

A successful design study is a product of effective collaboration. The following elements were key to our success:

1.  **Shared Language:** By using the task taxonomies (Brehmer & Munzner, Amar et al.), both computer and domain experts had a shared language to describe needs and capabilities.
2.  **Mutual Respect:** The computer experts respected the domain expert's knowledge, and the domain expert trusted the computer experts' design choices.
3.  **Active Documentation:** Instead of just a final report, the logs created a living document of the collaborative process, capturing every "aha" moment and every challenge.
4.  **Tangible Artifacts:** The sketches, prototypes, and code implementations served as tangible conversation pieces. They moved the collaboration beyond abstract discussions and into a concrete, shared reality.

## Collaboration Intensity by Phase

| Phase | Collaboration Intensity | Key Collaborators | Focus |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Stage 1 | High | Domain expert + researcher | Understanding problems and workflows |
| Stage 2 | Medium | Domain expert + designer | Validating design concepts and iterations |
| Stage 3 | Low | Primarily developer | Technical implementation with periodic check-ins |
| Stage 4 | High | Domain expert + researcher | Usability testing and validation |
| Stage 5 | Medium | Full team | Reflection and documentation |

## Collaboration Models That Worked

### Co-Design Sessions
**Frequency:** Weekly during Stages 1 and 2, bi-weekly during Stage 3
**Participants:** Domain expert (Mark), researcher/designer, occasional technical advisor
**Format:** In-person preferred, remote when necessary, structured with specific goals

#### Effective Practices:
- **Preparation:** Always sent agenda and materials 24 hours in advance
  - Prepared specific questions based on previous session outcomes
  - Shared visual materials (sketches, prototypes) before sessions to allow review time

- **Facilitation:** Used collaborative sketching and think-aloud protocols
  - Started each session with recap of previous decisions and rationale
  - Used "How might we..." questions to maintain solution focus
  - Encouraged criticism and alternative suggestions with "What if..." prompts

- **Documentation:** Live note-taking with immediate read-back for validation
  - Photographed all sketches immediately after sessions
  - Sent summary within 24 hours with action items and next steps

#### Sample Session Structure:
1. **Opening (10 min):** Review previous decisions and current context
2. **Context Setting (15 min):** Domain expert shares recent relevant experiences
3. **Collaborative Activity (45 min):** Sketch review, iteration, or problem-solving
4. **Synthesis (15 min):** Summarize insights and validate understanding
5. **Next Steps (5 min):** Define specific deliverables and timeline for next session

### Regular Check-ins
**Frequency:** Twice weekly during active development phases
**Duration:** 30 minutes maximum
**Participants:** Domain expert and lead developer/designer

#### Meeting Effectiveness Factors:
- **Agenda Structure:** Status update, specific questions, demo of progress, next priorities
- **Time Management:** Strict 30-minute limit encouraged focus and preparation
- **Decision Making:** Used "decision, discussion, or information" framework for each agenda item
- **Action Items:** Always ended with specific, assignable tasks with deadlines

### Expert Reviews
**Timing:** End of Stage 1, midpoint of Stage 2, before final implementation
**Participants:** Domain expert plus 2-3 colleagues from transportation department
**Format:** Structured presentation followed by guided discussion

#### Review Effectiveness:
- **Preparation:** Created specific materials for each review (personas, task flows, interactive prototypes)
- **Question Framework:** Focused on "Does this match your experience?" and "What would you change?"
- **Feedback Integration:** Prioritized feedback based on frequency of mention and alignment with core tasks

## Communication Strategies

### Communication Channels

#### Primary Channels:

| Channel | Purpose | Frequency | Participants |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Email | Formal updates, sharing materials, scheduling | Daily during active phases | All stakeholders |
| Video calls | Co-design sessions, demos, complex discussions | 2-3x per week | Core team |
| Shared Google Drive | Version control, collaborative documents, sketches | Continuous | All team members |
| Slack | Quick questions, informal updates, file sharing | As needed | Development team |

#### Communication Protocols:
- **Response Times:** 24 hours for email, 4 hours for Slack during business days
- **Escalation:** Phone call for urgent issues, video call for complex problems
- **Documentation:** All decisions and rationale documented in shared log, meeting notes always shared within 24 hours

### Information Sharing

#### Documentation Strategy:
- **Central Repository:** Google Drive shared folder with organized sections for each handbook stage
- **Version Control:** Date-based file naming with clear "current" versions, archived older versions in dated folders  
- **Access Permissions:** Full team access to working documents, read-only sharing with stakeholders for major milestones

#### Knowledge Transfer:
- **Onboarding:** Initial 2-hour session covering domain context, design process overview, and role expectations
- **Context Sharing:** Weekly domain updates where expert shared recent experiences, challenges, or contextual changes
- **Technical Communication:** Avoided jargon, used transportation analogies to explain design concepts, always checked understanding

### Language and Terminology

#### Vocabulary Management:
- **Glossary Development:** Maintained shared document mapping transportation terms to visualization concepts
- **Translation Needs:** Created explicit bridges between "delays" (domain) and "outliers" (visualization), "routes" vs. "categories"
- **Clarity Checks:** Regular "Let me paraphrase what I heard..." discussions to verify mutual understanding

#### Cultural Considerations:
- **Communication Styles:** Domain expert preferred concrete examples, design team used abstract principles - incorporated both approaches
- **Time Zones:** All collaborators in same geographic area - no distribution challenges
- **Hierarchy:** Domain expert was senior in organization - maintained respect while ensuring design autonomy

## Relationship Building

### Trust Development

### Trust Development

#### Trust-Building Activities:
- **Transparent Process:** Shared all design rationale and decision-making criteria openly with domain expert

- **Expertise Recognition:** Regularly acknowledged domain expert's insights and gave credit for improvements

#### Trust Indicators:
- **Open Criticism:** Domain expert became increasingly comfortable critiquing designs and suggesting alternatives
- **Proactive Sharing:** Domain expert began volunteering relevant context and information without being asked
- **Autonomy Comfort:** Domain expert expressed comfort with design team making decisions between meetings
