- **Document 2:** [Internal knowledge sharing artifact]sketch to the final product.
* **The Power of Low-Fidelity:** Hand-drawn sketches were crucial. They allowed for a fast and non-committal way to explore ideas. Domain experts felt more comfortable critiquing a rough sketch than a polished visualization.
* **Documentation is Key:** The logs for data cleaning, sketches, and build decisions were invaluable. They created a clear and traceable record of the entire process, which was essential for our final report and for understanding the design rationale.
* **Tacit Knowledge is Gold:** The "think-aloud" sessions and observations were more informative than the formal interviews. They helped us uncover pain points that the domain expert took for granted.

## Detailed Stage Reflections

### Stage 1: Abstract Phase

#### What Worked Well:
- **Semi-structured Interviews:** Open-ended questions revealed unexpected pain points about manual data correlation
- **Task Observation:** Watching the domain expert work revealed the "Wednesday problem" pattern
- **Iterative Abstraction:** Multiple rounds of task refinement led to the three core tasks (compare, find anomaly, locate hotspot)

#### What Could Be Improved:
- **Initial Scope:** Started too broad - should have focused on specific use cases earlier
- **Technical Feasibility:** Didn't consider data limitations early enough, leading to some redesign

#### Key Insights:
- **Task Abstraction:** Real tasks emerged from observation rather than interviews - people don't always know what they need
- **User Interviews:** Follow-up questions were crucial - initial answers were often surface-level
- **Domain Understanding:** Transportation domain has hidden complexities (weather, time-of-day effects) that only emerged through deep engagement

#### Time Allocation:
- **Planned:** 1 week
- **Actual:** 1.5 weeks  
- **Variance:** Extra time needed for task refinement was valuable investment

### Stage 2: Design Phase

#### What Worked Well:
- **Hand-drawn Sketching:** Rapid iteration without tool constraints - generated 8 different layout concepts
- **Multiple Views Early:** Decided on coordinated views approach early, which guided all subsequent design decisions
- **Color Strategy:** Delay-based color coding (red-yellow-green) was intuitive and tested well

#### What Could Be Improved:
- **Data Volume Planning:** Didn't consider how design would scale with larger datasets
- **Responsive Design:** Late addition - should have been considered from the start

#### Key Insights:
- **Sketching Process:** Physical sketching encouraged broader exploration than jumping to digital tools
- **Digital Tools:** Figma excellent for layout refinement, but VegaLite prototyping caught interaction issues early
- **Design Validation:** Quick digital prototypes prevented major implementation problems

#### Iteration Effectiveness:
- **Number of Iterations:** 5 major design iterations
- **Most Valuable Iteration:** Iteration 3 - added geographic view after realizing spatial patterns were crucial
- **Iteration Drivers:** User feedback and technical constraints drove most changes

---

### Stage 3: Build Phase

#### What Worked Well:
- **Incremental Development:** Building one chart at a time allowed for early testing and refinement
- **D3.js Choice:** Provided the flexibility needed for custom interactions and coordinated views
- **Responsive Framework:** CSS Grid made layout adaptation straightforward

#### What Could Be Improved:
- **Error Handling:** Added too late in the process - should be built in from the start
- **Performance Testing:** Didn't test with larger datasets until late - found some bottlenecks

#### Key Insights:
- **Technology Choices:** D3.js learning curve was worth it for the custom interaction requirements
- **Performance Considerations:** Animation and transitions significantly improved user experience
- **Design-to-Code Translation:** Having detailed Figma mockups made implementation much smoother

#### Technical Debt:
- **Accumulated Debt:** [Technical shortcuts that created future problems]
- **Time Pressure Impact:** [How time constraints affected code quality]
- **Lessons for Future:** [How to better manage technical debt]

### Stage 4: Evaluate Phase

#### What Worked Well:
- **Structured Tasks:** The three-task evaluation protocol effectively tested core functionality
- **Think-Aloud Protocol:** Captured reasoning process and revealed usability insights
- **Time-boxed Tasks:** 3-minute limit encouraged focused interaction and revealed efficiency issues

#### What Could Be Improved:
- **Single User:** Only testing with one domain expert limited feedback diversity
- **Task Realism:** Could have included more complex, real-world scenarios

#### Key Insights:
- **Coordinated Views:** Proved to be the most valuable feature - users immediately understood the connections
- **Learning Curve:** Minimal training needed - intuitive interface was achieved
- **Performance Expectations:** Users expect instant responsiveness in modern web tools

### Process and Team Insights

#### Time Management:
- **Stage 1 (Abstract):** 1.5 weeks - Longer than expected but crucial for foundation
- **Stage 2 (Design):** 2 weeks - Hand sketching saved significant time later
- **Stage 3 (Build):** 3 weeks - Incremental development prevented major setbacks
- **Stage 4 (Evaluate):** 1 week - Could have been longer for multiple users
- **Total:** 7.5 weeks vs. 6 week target

#### Role Clarity:
- **Researcher/Designer:** Dual role worked well for small project, clear division of abstract vs. design thinking
- **Developer Role:** Having design background made implementation smoother
- **Domain Expert:** Regular check-ins prevented development of unusable features

#### Stakeholder Engagement:
- **Engagement Strategies:** Weekly demos kept domain expert engaged and provided regular course correction
- **Feedback Integration:** Prioritizing feedback based on core task support worked well
- **Expectation Management:** Early prototypes helped set realistic expectations for final product

### Technical Learnings

#### Tool Effectiveness:

| Tool/Technology | Effectiveness (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| D3.js | 5 | Learning curve steep but flexibility was essential |
| Figma | 4 | Excellent for layout design, good collaboration features |
| VegaLite | 3 | Good for rapid prototyping, limited for complex interactions |
| HTML/CSS Grid | 5 | Modern responsive design approach, very effective |
| VS Code | 5 | Excellent development environment with good extensions |

#### Data Challenges:
- **Data Quality Issues:** Transport data had inconsistent formatting - required significant cleaning
- **Data Access:** Mock data worked well for prototype, but real API integration would add complexity  
- **Data Processing:** D3's data manipulation functions were powerful but required JavaScript expertise

### User-Centered Design Insights

#### User Understanding:
- **User Model Evolution:** Initial assumption of "data analyst" user evolved to "operations manager" with different needs
- **Persona Validation:** Domain expert matched our target persona well, but broader user base would have different priorities
- **Task Understanding:** Real tasks were more exploratory than we initially assumed - needed support for discovery

#### Design Validation:
- **Early Validation Benefits:** Hand-drawn sketches prevented weeks of development in wrong direction
- **Iteration Impact:** User feedback in Stage 2 completely changed our chart selection approach
- **Design Blindspots:** Assumed users would want complex filtering - simple route selection was sufficient

## Methodological Contributions

### Process Improvements:
1. **Integrated Sketching-Prototyping:** Combining hand sketches with rapid digital prototyping
   - **Problem Addressed:** Gap between conceptual design and technical implementation
   - **Implementation:** Use sketches for broad exploration, VegaLite for interaction testing, then build

2. **Continuous Domain Expert Engagement:** Weekly check-ins throughout development
   - **Problem Addressed:** Building features that don't match real-world needs
   - **Implementation:** Schedule brief weekly demos rather than waiting for major milestones

### Tool Recommendations:
- **Essential Tools:** Hand sketching materials, Figma (or similar), D3.js (for flexibility), basic web hosting
- **Helpful Additions:** VegaLite for prototyping, color picker tools, browser dev tools for debugging
- **Tools to Avoid:** Overly complex frameworks early on - start simple and add complexity only when needed

### Template Improvements:
- **Documentation Templates:** Add specific time tracking templates - actual time vs. estimates revealed valuable insights
- **Process Checklists:** Need checklist for data quality assessment early in the process
- **Evaluation Frameworks:** Single-user evaluation sufficient for initial validation, but multi-user framework needed for robustness

## Domain-Specific Insights

### Transportation Domain Characteristics:
